The models we will evaluate include linear regression, k-NN, decision tree, logistic regression, and SVM. We will use a dataset to train and test these models, calculate metrics such as accuracy, Jaccard index, F1 score, and log loss, and compare the results to determine which model performs best in this context."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Data Science Languages\n","\n","1.
